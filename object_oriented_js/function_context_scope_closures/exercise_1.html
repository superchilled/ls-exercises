    <h1>Object Oriented JavaScript | Function Context, Scope, and Closures</h1>
    <h2>Exercise 1:	What is This</h2>
    <p>Read the following code carefully. What do you think is logged on line 7. Try to answer the question before you run the code.
    <code>
      var person = { <br>
        firstName: 'Rick ',<br>
        lastName: 'Sanchez',<br>
        fullName: this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName,<br>
      };<br>
<br>
      console.log(person.fullName);<br>
    </code></p>
    <h2>Answer</h2>
    <p>Line 7 will log <code>undefined undefined</code>, because `fullName` is not a method, it isn't being being executed, and so there is not an execustion context to consider here. When the object is create, `this` is the global object and `firstName` and `lastName` are `undefined` on the global object and so this is what is set as the values for `fullName`.</p>
<script>
var person = {
  firstName: 'Rick ',
  lastName: 'Sanchez',
  fullName: this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName,
};

console.log(person.fullName);
</script>
